If everything had started over again, I would have shook off the shackles of intuition, unleashed the spontaneous impulsion and yelled out the inner voice, regardless of the possible mistakes triggered. I desire to imitate the eagle to soar freely in the spacious sky, horse to roam wildly in the cast grasslands, setting aside the undue caution and intense seriousness. Had my life over again, mistakes were welcomed, accompanied by pleasure, levity and success.

By and large, following your own heart is what almost everyone wants, despite the fact that the gap between the actual and the ideal fetters us to behave just like being manipulated. Take me as an example, in order to gain admission into elite schools, I was reluctantly forced to give up my favourite stuff: sports, but devote myself to studying. It is just the cruel reality that contributes to our youth outflow and the dream discolouration. Otherwise, few limits on our development, we would dare to pursue what we intend and embrace the ideal life. 

What is more, needless to say that, more mistakes allowed, we will have more room to express  our  individuality instead of replicating others considered as successful people. Nowadays, we are increasingly afraid of making mistakes, which, to some extent, constrain the development of our personality. We would have become more innovative and enterprising if we would dare to make more attempts. Besides, we will not follow the footsteps of those successful people to avoid making mistakes at the cost of sacrificing the opportunity of expressing ourselves.  

As to whether or not to err, there is a widespread belief that mistakes cannot be tolerated and we should spare no efforts to avoid them. Fewer errors may lead to a comparably satisfactory life. More mistakes, however, do not necessarily mean a miserable life. On the contrary, full reflection upon the mistakes we made will stimulate us to grow and gain. As the proverb goes, a fault confessed is half redressed. It is not horrible to err, but to ignore mistakes made. As a result, more mistakes may bring you more experience rather than more pain, full reflection on which will make it conducive for you to explore your world in the correct and smooth way.
